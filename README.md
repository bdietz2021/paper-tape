Todays computers did not appear suddenly in their current form - the evolved from room-sized mainframes to minicomputers the size of a file cabinet before they morphed into desktop computers and then smart phones. 
My first job at Honeywell was to program an H316 minicomputer. 

This repository shows how I recently built a paper tape reader to resurect a couple of old programs from 50-some years ago. It's just a hobby project. As useful and fun as a model railroad. Look at the slides
for more information on the "how and why" paper tape was used in those days.
